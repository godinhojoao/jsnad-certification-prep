## Q: What are the Testing location Rules? https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/lf-handbook2/candidate-requirements#testing-environment-requirements

The place where you’ll take your exam is one of your most crucial decisions.
For best results, prepare your testing environment before exam day to ensure it will be private, quiet, well lit and cleared of personal items. You will be asked to scan the room from which you are testing in, prior to launching your exam. If there are notes, drinks, a box of tissues or any such items on your desk, you will be asked to remove them prior to releasing the exam.
Full details of Testing Location Rules are published in the Linux Foundation Candidate handbook.

## Q: What ID can I present to the Proctor to check in?

You must present valid, unexpired Government Issued ID during the check-in process.
The Linux Foundation Candidate Handbook provides a concise list of requirements and acceptable ID(s).

Exam sessions are available in the scheduling calendar up to 90 days in advance.

## Q: Can I Cancel and/or Reschedule my exam reservation?

You may cancel or reschedule your test appointment up to 24 hours before the scheduled start time of your exam. Reservation changes are NOT POSSIBLE when 24 hours or less remain before the exam start time.

## Q: If I have technical issues while taking my exam, what should I do?

The proctor and PSI Technical Support team do not have the technical knowledge or background to troubleshoot errors affecting the exam server, or issues you may have answering exam items (exam questions).

Their main function during the exam is to facilitate the check-in process, monitor the session and provide support for issues with the Secure Browser.

If you need assistance with the Secure Browser during your exam, you should initiate a chat with the online test administrator using the in exam chat tool.

## Q: How can I request Test Accommodations? (e.g. Additional Time, Screen Reader etc)

You can request test accommodations by completing the Test Accommodations Form, and submitting it for approval to trainingsupport.linuxfoundation.org.
