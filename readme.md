## Important tips and warnings:

- Reference: https://www.max-gherman.dev/blog/2021/02/07/jsnad-certification/
  - You can use Node.js documentation during the exam, but your proctor might not know that. Ask the proctor for the ability to use the docs and show them this page in case they say "No".
    - https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/certification-resources-allowed#openjs-node-js-application-developer-jsnad-and-openjs-node-js-services-developer-jsnsd
  - Run your code on the terminal before submitting, at least check the syntax with `node -c answer.js`.

  - Every task folder has a README file with the task description. Don't waste your time on reading it in the browser (save time).
  - Turn on "word wrap" on VSCode (save time).
  - Turn on "auto save" on VSCode (save time).
  - Use VSCode integrated terminal, to avoid lose time switching between tabs (save time).

  - Iâ€™d like to draw your attention to the kind of tricky moment while working in a remote environment: a number of participants state that the system is quite laggy and it could be extremely uncomfortable to write code. (Remember times you were coding with a processor loaded at 100% and characters appeared on the screen only after a second delay after a click â€” so something similar could happen during the exam.) Just keep in mind that your skills should be strong enough for you not to be distracted by this sort of a red rag.
